# Operating System Concepts (CGS3763)
## University of Central Florida - Spring 2023

This repository contains my assignments and projects for **CGS3763 - Operating System Concepts** at the University of Central Florida during **Spring 2023**.

In this course, I explored modern operating systems, covering topics such as system calls, processes, threading, CPU scheduling, memory management, security issues, and client/server paradigms. I also learned about the terminology, hardware, and software associated with operating system components and structures.

Course taken with Karin Markle.
